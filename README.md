## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Lexend Deca Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lexend+Deca)
- [Inter Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)

### What I learned

I learnt some of bootstrap's screen sizing. That is, the different screen breakpoints that I came across during this project.
```md - 762px```
```lg - 992px```
```xl - 1200px```

These are the screen breakpoints I used at one point in the project or to complete the project and I believe they will be helpful in future projects.

### Continued development

I plan to minimize my use of pure CSS and keep on learning bootstrap so as to be more efficient when writing code.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) - If you want to get started with bootstrap or even if
you are already proficient in it, always refer to the docs. It is a real life-saver.
